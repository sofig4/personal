            <h4>Major:</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: rgb(0, 30, 100)">Computer Engineer Student with minor in Data Science</p>
            <h4>About Me:</h4>
            <p> Motivated junior in Computer Engineering eager to secure a challenging summer internship position to apply and  
                enhance my technical skills, gain practical experience in the field, and contribute to innovative projects within a dynamic  
                team environment.</p>
            <h4>Passion and Morals:</h4>
            <p>I was born in Torreon Mexico, then at age three my family moved to Waterloo Iowa where I have lived since. As a kid I was involved with multiple activities such as soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball, and theater. I graduated Columbus Catholic High School in May 2022 and continued my education at Iowa State, where I am currently enrolled at as a Computer Engineering major with a Data Science minor. </p>
            <h4>Current:</h4>
            <p>I  have always loved technology, when little my dad and I would take about remote cars and put them back together. My family would call me Steve Jobs for any time new technology came out at a young age I would know all the specs and new features. A big passion of mine with technology is making it the most sustainable and affordable as possible. I am a big outdoor person and I would like to preserve the earth as much as possible and I believe technology should be accessible to everyone. Being from Mexico I saw first had how important technology is to education and not many people in Mexico could afford a simple tablet. I would like to innovate new technology while keeping it accessible for everyone.</p>
