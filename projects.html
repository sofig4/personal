            <h3>Enhancing Data Visualization for Object Avoidance using a Graphical User Interface</h3>
            <p>In the summer of 2023 I worked with LSAMP IINSPIRE on a research project of my choosing. I decided to upgrade the capabilities of the Create 2 iRobots (CyBot) used in CPRE 288 labs. Using the collection of ping sensor data, the goal of the project was to assist students in creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that will meet the need of the user using the CyBot.</p>

            <h3>School Projects
            </h3>
            <p>
                Overview: Through the class CprE185, we completed nine labs that required us to code in C++ to complete certain tasks.
            </p> 
            <p>  Lab 9 — DS4 TalkerDecember 2022 - 2 weeks to finish</p>
                <p>  Create a program that would allow people who have vocal disabilities to be able to speak with other people. The program would generate sentences that the user wishes and type them out. 
                The problem required using a file that would print out a list of words and from there the user can use the DS4 to select words. Using the joysticks and the button the user would be able to go through the word list and select whatever they wanted and then be able to select the word with a space, without a space, and delete a word. The sentence would be printed at the bottom of the word list.
                </p>
                
                <p> Lab 8 — Maze RunnerNovember 2022 - 1 weeks to finish</p>
                    <p> Create a maze game that an avatar had to manage through and make it to the bottom of the screen.
                The problem required to create prototypes that would generate a maze design and an avatar moving down the screen. The avatar should have a delay when it falls down the screen and depending on the difficulty chosen will determine the amount of stars printed to the maze.
                /p>
                
                <p>Lab 6 — DS4 EqualizerOctober 2022 - 1 weeks to finish</p>
                    <p>Detect which direction the DualShock4 was facing,  right or left and up or down.
                The problem required to follow the skeleton code and not change a part of the code nor modify it. Only using the function they created we had to create prototypes and a while loop to make the code work.
               </p>
                
                <p>Lab 5 — DS4 DropOctober 2022 - 2 weeks to finish</p>
                    <p>Detect how far the DualShock4 fell in how much time. Part 2 of the lab was then required to calculate air resistance and compare the drop from the one without air resistance. 
                The problem required to create loops that would switch depending on a conditional to calculate the fall. Then add a feature to the program based on a formula that incorporates the magnitude of the acceleration as the DualShock4 falls. The set up was at x0=0 , the time can be called t0 and the velocity vi =0 . As the DualShock 4 falls, the velocity (v) changes as vi =vi-1 + g (1 − mag(acc)) (ti -ti-1), where g is gravity. Then, the position, x, changes as xi= xi-1 + vi(ti -ti-1).
